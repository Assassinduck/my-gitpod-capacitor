Problem:

Chrome needs root:root user and 4775 mode but user is gitpod:gitpod and mode is 775. Does not run. In gitpod we have no access to sudo so this is a bit of a pain.

Installation
To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use npm. The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your app:

npm install electron --save-devCopy
See the Electron versioning doc for info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps.

Global Installation
You can also install the electron command globally in your $PATH:

npm install electron -gCopy
Customization
If you want to change the architecture that is downloaded (e.g., ia32 on an x64 machine), you can use the --arch flag with npm install or set the npm_config_arch environment variable:

npm install --arch=ia32 electronCopy
In addition to changing the architecture, you can also specify the platform (e.g., win32, linux, etc.) using the --platform flag:

npm install --platform=win32 electron
